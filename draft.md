How does AI teacher help English speaking class?

Hello everyone, I’m so lucky to be the first one to deliver a speech here. My topic today is to discuss how AI helps us to improve spoken English, which has a closed relationship with this class.

Last month, I went to GMIC, the Global Mobile Internet Conference with my friends. GMIC is a global platform that connects innovators worldwide. Since its first edition in 2009, GMIC has become a must-attend event for companies, industry professionals and technology enthusiasts. Beijing is one of the eight technology hubs around globe GMIC 2017 spans. And it was organized in the National Conference Center. 

When I walk into the hall, I was shocked. There are lots of banners hanging down from the ceiling written “Artificial Intelligence” and blabla. I read the schedule post. More than 80% presentation topics are about AI and big data. It can’t be denied AI has been combined with various industries, including medical, business, education and so on. I was interested in education, so listened to the presentations about education. Surprisingly, the most impressive product is about spoken English, named English Liulishuo, it’s an app for practicing spoken English. Maybe some of you know it or used it to practice your spoken English. Anyone here? I heard about it before I went to there, but I never thought of any relationship between it and AI. 

Liulishuo is a platform to learn spoken English, there are lots of online courses. But the kernel function in technology of this app is to judge spoken English automatically and intelligently,  and evaluate by a score, and marked out which word you pronounced not standard enough. It sounds very simple. Because it is easy for people, especially for English teachers. But for machines, the back end is an intelligent agent. 

To know how this intelligent agent work, we must know how AI works first. As we know, AI is to make a machine an intelligent agent like human beings. It seems like they can think, make decisions like a smart person. But how this can be achieved? By data, lots of data, big data. Imagine there is a pipe, you put something in it, and it export something out. If the export result is right, give a positive feedback. Otherwise, give a negative one. After training with plenty of data, when you give a input sample, which you don’t know what the result will be. The pipe will give you a result. It seems to be intelligent, isn’t it? As a Go player, alpha go was trained by lots of game data. And for Liulishuo, it collects users’ voice into a library as the training data. With more and more data added into the library, the intelligent agent gets more and more strong and accurate.

It costs Liulishuo so much money and labors to build this AI teacher. Is it meaningful? English teachers can do the same things, don’t they? But we must notice that an English teacher has limited time and energy while the app has unlimited. If only you have a smart phone, it can correct your pronunciation anywhere,anytime. It won’t be tired any more. We have listening and speaking class once a week, our dear teacher cannot company us everyone to practice everyday, but the app can. When we finish the final test, the class ends. If you haven’t improved enough, you can’t take this classes once more, what you can do is to install the app and keep practicing everyday. 

As we can see, AI boosted education with lots of repeatable work. It makes easier and more convenient for us to practice spoken English. Besides it is more standard since there may be difference on pronunciations among different teachers. The AI teacher even does better than people.
